subject: Compressing Icelandic name declension patterns into a 3.27 kB trie — Alex Harri

Hello! Last weekend I published a new post:

[Compressing Icelandic name declension patterns into a 3.27 kB trie](https://alexharri.com/blog/icelandic-name-declension-trie)

This post takes a look at some interesting compression techniques I used when building [beygla](https://github.com/alexharri/beygla) — a library for Icelandic name declension.

The post did quite well on HN, reaching the top spot for a few hours. You can [click here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44766718) to view the discussion.

Best,
